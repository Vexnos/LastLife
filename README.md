# Last Life
This is a Last Life datapack created by myself for version 1.21.1, inspired by Grian's Last Life series.

## Game Mechanics
I recommend a worldborder cap of 700 for the best experience.

To start the game, have everyone on the server and run `/function lastlife:init` and then run `/function lastlife:start`.

To randomly roll lives, run `function lastlife:roll/init`, otherwise everyone will start on 3 lives.

To pause the session, run `/function lastlife:pause`, to resume run `/function lastlife:start`

To start the Boogeyman, run `/function lastlife:boogeyman/init`.

To gift a life, run `/trigger gift` and make sure the person you want to give the life to is the closest player to you. You cannot give lives to people who are out, red names can't give lives to people as they would be out.

If you need to manually set anyone's lives for whatever reason, you can do that by running `/scoreboard players set @s lives <amount>`

## Custom Crafting Recipes
Unlike TNT requiring paper in Last Life, we've decided to implement the ability to smelt sugar into gunpowder while preserving the original TNT recipe.

You cannot craft the Enchanting Table, you have to manually place one at the start of the game.

Gravel can be smelted into Sand.

Other custom recipes are from VanillaTweaks as they are just so vanilla friendly, we couldn't play without them!
